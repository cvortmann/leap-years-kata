# Leap Years empty Kata project

This project serves as a bootstrap project for participants to practice Test Driven Development
(TDD) as part of a [TDD: What it is & Why you Should Care | Guided Learning Hour][tddGuided]
session.

Clone this repo and make sure you can run the tests from inside IntelliJ Idea (or your favorite IDE).

## Kata Description

Write a function that returns true or false depending on whether its input integer is a leap year or
not.

A leap year is defined as one that is divisible by 4, but is not otherwise divisible by 100 unless
it is also divisible by 400.

For example, 2001 is a typical common year and 1996 is a typical leap year, whereas 1900 is an
atypical common year and 2000 is an atypical leap year.
